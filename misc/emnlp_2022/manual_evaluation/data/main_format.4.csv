Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mockingof education, the justice system, and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.","parody, satire, and irony",What does Lee use to address complex issues?,What does Tavernier-Courbin say Lee uses effectively by using a child's perspective?,What did Tavernier-Courbin say Lee used to address complex issues?,What does Tavernier-Courbin say Lee uses to address complex issues?,How does Lee use satire and irony to address complex issues?,What does Lee use to address complex issues?,"Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced.

"In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms ""symbolic reference"", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. ","An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair."," However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, ""might not have jumped to the notion of a chair"", but instead ""might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape."" This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog ""would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such."" In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).","An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair",How does symbolic reference work?,How does Whitehead describe a person's encounter with a chair?,What is an example of symbolic reference?,How does an ordinary person know a chair is a chair?,What does an ordinary person immediately infer when they see a colored shape?,What is the term for a person who takes a yellow shape?,"When talking about genome composition, one should distinguish between prokaryotes and eukaryotes as the big differences on contents structure they have.

By the end of the decade there were 30 kerosene plants operating in the United States. The cheaper, more efficient fuel began to drive whale oil out of the market. John D. Rockefeller was most responsible for the commercial success of kerosene.

The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials.
