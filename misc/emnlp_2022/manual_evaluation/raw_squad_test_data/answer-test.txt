Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts
important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life
For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary, value-free school model
it should be transdisciplinary, and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom

he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education

"Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized."

By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete

each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago
Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things
The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything
in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves
It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects.
it obscures the importance of relations

in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it
A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it
if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist
Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they are what the thing is.

It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved.
those experiences go on to change the way God interacts with the world

Whitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another
He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide
by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time

"religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious."
a system of general truths that transformed a person's character
while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good
solitariness
"the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals."
meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community
The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself

Bruno Latour
Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs
Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine

process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests
"an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone."
religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world
a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society
It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people.
pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior
ontology that "understands becoming as a relational process; difference as being related, yet unique; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference."
